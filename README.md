# Correlation_Coefficient_app
The Django Rest Framework API application works with TweleData API to provide Correlation Coefficient as well as Percentage Change and and HLOC data for Trend Analysis.
The App hopes to use Machine Learning to perform Trend Analysis. A frontend is coming soon after I learn react.
